# RAG Athenna Framework ðŸ¤–

> Implementation of RAG techniques to teach GPT about Athenna Framework so he could answer any question that the developers might have.

## Tools

The project uses the following tools to work:

- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)
- [Chroma as Vector DB](https://www.trychroma.com/)
- [GPT 3.5 Turbo as LLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#gpt-3-5-turbo)
- [ADA 002 for Text Embedding](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models#embeddings)

## Running

To run the project first create a new Python environment and activate it. I'm using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for setting the python version that pipenv should use to set up the environment. The command bellow will automatically setup the environment with conda and pipenv:

```shell
make env
```

Now install all the project dependencies:

```shell
make install-all
```

Clone the repositories you want the model to code review:

```shell
make clone
```

You can change the repositories you want to clone inside `bin/clone.py`. Also take a look inside `bin/insert.py`
when calling `load_code_folder_chunks()` function to verify which paths and code languages you want to include in
the VectorDB. You can also define files that you want to exclude.

Insert the file chunks in Chroma database by running:

```shell
make insert
```

Ask something by running the following:

```shell
make ask
```

You can change your question inside `bin/ask.py`.

## Examples

> Question:

How I could change the routes directory in Athenna Framework?

> Model Answer:

To change the routes directory in Athenna Framework, you can update the `.athennarc.json` configuration file by modifying the `directories` property. By default, the routes directory is located at `"routes": "src/routes"`. 

If you want to change the routes directory to a different location, you can simply update the `"routes"` key within the `directories` property to point to the new directory path. For example, if you want to change the routes directory to `"app/routes"`, you can update the configuration as follows:

```json
{
  "directories": {
    "routes": "app/routes"
  }
}
```

After updating the configuration file, Athenna will look for route files in the new directory specified in the `directories` property. Remember to run your application with the updated configuration for the changes to take effect.
